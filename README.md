# The Mail Service

Our mail service needs a new scheduling system for its facility coming online... next month!

The mail/parcels are receieved at our service/distribution center. There are number of rail lines (train tracks) extending out where eventually items will reach their destinations.

Each parcel of mail has a

- Weight (kg)
- Volume in cm<sup>3</sup>

**Train Operators** bid to carry these parcels in trains which have a maximum weight and a maximum
volume.

**Parcel Owners** submit parcels to be shipped via our APIs.

## Hiring Trains & Charging Parcel Owners

Our mail service hires trains from the Train Operators and assigns parcels to them. It then charges each Parcel Owner a proportionate amount of the cost of shipping their parcel.

If we charge Parcel Owners too much, they will shift to another operator, so it is in our best interest to charge the owners as little as possible (turns out we're a government entity).

## Interface, Data Models

- Entrypoint can be anything, just tell us how to run your program. Assume these operators are console savvy!

### Train Operators

- Tell the system
  - Trains that are currently available
  - Current capacity and cost
  - Lines they can operate on
  - Withdraw bids
- Ask the system
  - Status of their train(s)
    - Line that it is assigned to (if booked`+`left)
    - Time the train left (if booked`+`left)
    - Parcels & Parcel Info (if booked`+`left)

### Parcel Owners

- Tell the system
  - A parcel for shipping
  - To withdraw a package
- Ask the system
  - has the package shipped
  - the cost of shipping

### Post Master

- Book`+`Fill`+`Send the train

## Constraints

- Train Operator posts an offer for a train, which Post Master can then book, fill and send, it unless it was previously withdrawn.
- When you book a train, it is instantly filled and leaves.
- Trains are a one-time thing when you book a train for a line, it is used and cannot be rebooked. Trains will be re-submitted by the Train Operator as new trains.
- Booked trains take 3h to run. This makes the line unavailable during that time.
  - If you send a train on an occupied line, they will crash!

## Example

An example configuration might be:

3 Lines - A, B, C

Trains:

- Thomas - cost 200, total weight 500kg, total volume 8 m3, lines A B
- Percy - cost 150, total weight 150kg, total volume 1 m3, lines B C
- Evelyn - cost 300, total weight 300kg, total volume 4 m3, lines A C
- Toby - cost 250, total weight 100kg, total volume 2 m3, lines B C

Packages:

- 0001 - weight 1kg , volume 20 cm3
- 0002 - weight 0.5kg, volume 5 cm3
- ...

## Important Notes

Frontend is not required, though you should give enough documentation that we can verify your solution is correct.

- **Your solver must make an attempt to solve the optimisation problem** and you should document how far you decided to go in doing so.
- Needs to be DB backed, any DB of your choice.
- Needs good specs coverage, choice of any framework.

You will note that there are some ambiguities in the above, and some points where you will have to make design decisions. You should clearly note which ones you spotted and what restrictions you placed on behaviour in order to make the problem tractable.

This task can easily take way longer than 4 hours if you allow it so don't let that happen.
